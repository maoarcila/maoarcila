## Hi there, welcome to my profile!ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Andres, and I'm an UWaterloo alum with a Ph.D. in Applied Economics based in Toronto, Canada. I have been working as a Senior Data Scientist for more than 2 years and I worked at TD Bank in the Risk Management department for more than a year. If you'd like to see examples of my work, please [contact me](maoarcilav@gmail.com), as I keep most of my projects private by default.

Please feel free to visit my [LinkedIn]({https://www.linkedin.com/in/andres-arcila-ph-d-84435637/), or to email me!
