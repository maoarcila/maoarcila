## Hi there, welcome to my profile!ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Andres, I hold a Ph.D. in Applied Economics and I am based in Toronto, Canada. I have been working as a Senior Data Scientist for more than 2 years and I worked at TD Bank in the Risk Management department for more than a year. I am also a lecturer in the Department of Economics, and Political Science at the University of Waterloo where I teach Econometrics, Statistical Research Methods, and Public Economics. If you'd like to see examples of my work, please [contact me](mailto:maoarcilav@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]), as I keep most of my projects private by default.
