## Hi there, welcome to my profile!ðŸ‘‹

 My name is Andres, and I hold a Ph.D. in Applied Economics. Currently based in Toronto, Canada, I have over 2 years of experience as a Senior Data Scientist. In addition to my expertise in data science, I possess a background in the financial sector, having previously worked at TD Bank in the Risk Management department for more than a year.

I am also an esteemed lecturer in the Departments of Economics, and Political Science at the University of Waterloo. In this role, I teach courses in Econometrics, Statistical Research Methods, and Public Economics.

If you are interested in viewing examples of my work, feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:maoarcilav@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]). As a general practice, I maintain most of my projects as private, but I am more than willing to share them upon request.
