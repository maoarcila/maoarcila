## Hi there, welcome to my profile!ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andres, and I hold a Ph.D. in Applied Economics. Currently based in Toronto, Canada, I am Lead Data Scientist in the Growth Analytics at Affirm. I have over 3 years of experience as a Data Scientist and worked at TD Bank and Scotiabank in the Risk Management department for 2 years.

I am also an esteemed lecturer in the Departments of Economics, and Political Science at the University of Waterloo. In this role, I teach courses in Econometrics, Statistical Research Methods, and Public Economics.

If you are interested in viewing examples of my work, feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:maoarcilav@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]). As a general practice, I maintain most of my projects as private, but I am more than willing to share them upon request.
